# How Soccer Teams Come Back from Behind in Away Matches: Evidence from the English Premier League

Playing away matches is never easy, as players must perform under the pressure of thousands of spectators. The challenge becomes even greater when away teams fall behind on the scoreboard. Nevertheless, comebacks are not impossible, as numerous matches have shown away teams overturning deficits under hostile conditions. A notable example is Manchester United’s 3–2 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, despite trailing by two goals at halftime.
